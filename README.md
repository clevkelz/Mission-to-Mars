# Mission to Mars

The purpose of this exercise was to scrape information from four different Mars-related websites using BeautifulSoup and Splinter.  The information gathered is as follows:
- Latest Mars news from NASA: https://redplanetscience.com/
- Featured Mars Image from Jet Propulsion Laboratory:  https://spaceimages-mars.com
- Galaxy Facts for Earth and Mars:  https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/
- Images of Mars' Four Hemispheres:  https://marshemispheres.com/

Beautiful Soup and Splinter were used to scrape the information, which was then stored in a Mongo database.  Finally, html code was developed to format the website showing the scraped information.  There are four files in this repository used to accomplish the analysis.
